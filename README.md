## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rykov Dmitrii and i'm frontend/fullstack developer.

Throughout my journey as a developer, I have taken on various roles, including backend, frontend, and full-stack development. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in companies of all sizesâ€”small startups, medium-sized businesses, and large corporations. My colleagues have taught me a great deal about coding, building applications, and time management.

Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t always dedicated enough time to applying this knowledge in practical ways within my personal repositories. However, itâ€™s never too late to bridge this gap. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on creating projects and filling my portfolio with work that Iâ€™m passionate about.

My overarching goal is to provide inspiration and code examples for others who share a love for development and take pride in their work. Development isnâ€™t just about writing codeâ€”it can also be an act of artistry. Truly great projects are beautiful examples of innovative ideas and thoughtful design.

As with any skill, improvement comes with practiceâ€”consistent and deliberate practice.

*Let's all have fun and play together!*
